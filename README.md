## API Design
 
### API Concept
The Book Library Management System API enables users to manage book information through standard CRUD operations.
 
### Endpoint Design
- **GET /books:** Retrieve a list of all books in the library.
- **GET /books/{id}:** Retrieve a specific book by its unique ID.
- **POST /books:** Add a new book to the library.
- **PUT /books/{id}:** Update the details of a specific book.
- **DELETE /books/{id}:** Delete a specific book by ID.
 
### Request and Response Design
- **GET /books:**
  - *Request:*
    - Method: GET
    - URL: /books
  - *Response:*
    - JSON array containing information about all books in the library.
 
- **GET /books/{id}:**
  - *Request:*
    - Method: GET
    - URL: /books/{id}
  - *Response:*
    - JSON object containing information about a specific book.
 
- **POST /books:**
  - *Request:*
    - Method: POST
    - URL: /books
    - Body: JSON object containing information about a new book.
  - *Response:*

- **PUT /books/{id}:**
  - *Request:*
    - Method: PUT
    - URL: /books/{id}
    - Body: JSON object containing updated information about a specific book.
  - *Response:*
    - JSON object containing information about the updated book.
 
- **DELETE /books/{id}:**
  - *Request:*
    - Method: DELETE
    - URL: /books/{id}

## API Implementation
 
### Node.js and Express
The API is implemented using Node.js and the Express.js framework.
 
### Data Storage
In-memory data storage (e.g., an array) is used for basic CRUD operations on book data.
 
### Validation and Error Handling
Input validation is implemented for incoming requests. The API handles errors gracefully, providing appropriate error responses with status codes and error messages.
 
### Testing
Test cases are written using Mocha and Chai to verify that API endpoints work as expected.

## API Usage
 
### Client Implementation
A simple web page consumes the API using JavaScript. The Fetch API is used to make requests to API endpoints and display retrieved data. The client application demonstrates at least one POST request (adding a new book) and one GET request (retrieving a list of books).
 
### User Interface (UI)
A basic user interface is designed for the client application, allowing users to interact with the API effectively. Features include adding new books, updating book information, and deleting books. The UI is designed to be user-friendly and responsive.
